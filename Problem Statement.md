# Problem Statement

USSD channels are extremely sensitive to latency. Even a 2–3 second delay can break the user flow, return vague errors, or cause session drops.

Before integration, the bank struggled with:

- High system-induced fails during peak hours

- Unclear and inconsistent error messages

- Frequent timeouts due to long aggregator response cycles

- No unified flow structure for multiple services on the old aggregator

- Difficulty tracking failed journeys because logs lacked structure

The bank needed a new aggregator that could deliver:

- Faster response times

- Cleaner API contracts

- Better error mapping

- More consistent journeys

- Support for more USSD services (beyond airtime and bills)
