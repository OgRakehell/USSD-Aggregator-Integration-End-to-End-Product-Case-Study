# Overview

This project is a fictionalized reconstruction of an end-to-end USSD Aggregator Integration designed to demonstrate my product thinking, system understanding, and analytical process.

Although inspired by real digital-banking work I’ve done, no internal data, code, or proprietary system details are included. Everything here is sanitized, generalized, and designed purely as a portfolio case study.

The goal:
Integrate a new aggregator into the bank’s USSD ecosystem and optimize user journeys across airtime, bill payments, funds transfer, and mini-statement services.

I owned the product analysis, journey mapping, API documentation, and cross-functional coordination required to deliver a smooth, low-latency USSD experience.
